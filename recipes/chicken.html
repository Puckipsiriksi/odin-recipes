                    This recipe marries two of our favorite creamy comfort foods, spicy Chicken Tikka Masala and rich, garlicky Fettuccine Alfredo. Weirdly enough, Parmesan and curry are a pretty unbelievable pairing!

            <h2> Ingredients </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken thighs, patted dry with a paper towel</li>
                    <li>1/2 c. full-fat Greek yogurt</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. ginger, minced</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tsp. garam masala</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp. ground cumin</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp. cayenne Cooking spray</li>
                    <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
                        5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp. fresh ginger, minced</li>
                    <li>1 to 2 serrano peppers, seeded, deveined, and minced</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp. garam masala</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin</li>

                </ul>
            <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare chicken: In a large bowl, toss chicken thighs, yogurt, garlic, ginger, and spices until completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap, transfer to refrigerator, and marinate for 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare sauce: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, melt ghee over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, ginger, and serrano peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and beginning to brown on the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir in spices. Cook until very fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until dark red, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Whisk in water, ensuring there are no clumps, then add honey. Take off  heat and stir in cream. Use an immersion blender or carefully pour sauce into a traditional blender and blend sauce until totally smooth. Return sauce to pot.</li>
                <li>Position an oven rack 5" to 6" from the broiler and heat broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil and grease with cooking spray. Transfer marinated chicken to baking sheet, ensuring some yogurt remains on chicken.</li>
                <li>Broil chicken, flipping once halfway through, until cooked through and charred, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let cool, then roughly chop and add to sauce.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according to package directions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring sauce to a bare simmer and add cooked pasta and Parmesan. Cook, tossing, until everything is heated through, about 2 minutes. </li>
           </ol>
